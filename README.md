# board-game-utils

Toy project #42 or something, hopefully actually useful for my life

## Ideas / Goals
- [ ] Define RON board game schema for things
  - [ ] Serialize board game list to a markdown list (blog amibitions)
  - [ ] Allow for random picking of a game from the list based on paramters
    (likely need [BGG API][] integration to source some of these tags)
    - [ ] Number of players
    - [ ] Haven't played yet
    - [ ] Rating
    - [ ] Categories/tags
- [ ] Rule lookups (impossible but lets add it)
- [ ] Booking keeping (unlikely)
- [ ] Sync collection using [BGG API][], not useful for me but could be nice to
  have

Main goal is the RON stuff, but scope creep is fun and cool and good for toy
projects!
